Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was to improve the existing website for Horiseon, a digital marketing agency, and make it more accessible and user-friendly.

Objective:
The main objective of this project was to restructure the existing codebase to meet the latest web accessibility standards, improve the structure of the HTML and CSS, and optimize the code for search engines.

Problem:
The original codebase had many issues within its structure, making it difficult understand. There were also accessibility issues, making it challenging for people with disabilities to use the website. The code was not optimized for search engines, affecting Horiseon's online presence.


Solution:
The solution was to restructure the codebase to meet the latest web accessibility standards, make the website more user-friendly, and optimize it for search engines. The HTML code was modified to include semantic elements, making it easier to read and navigate. The CSS was optimized, reducing redundancy. Accessible attributes were also added to images, ensuring that the website was accessible to people with disabilities.

Learnings:
Through this project, I learned the importance of writing clean, well-organized code that meets web accessibility standards. We also learned the significance of optimizing a website for search engines to increase online visibility. 

Features:

-Improved code structure and organization
-Semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and readability, by removing the div element and separating the code by giving it a header, body, sections, and articles
-Accessible images with alt text for users with disabilities
-Optimized CSS for better performance
-Navigation links added to header for better user experience
-removed footer from visibility, can always be added in the future

Challenges:
One of the main challenges faced during this project was to ensure that the website remained visually appealing while also being optimized for search engines and web accessibility. Also being able to make sure that the code didn't break while changing the html tags to match the CSS sectors.
Trying to figure out what html elements to use instead if the div tags 
At first when I created the header tag, I was having a hard time figuring out why the format of the unordered list will break the format. Came to find out that I needed to adjust the CSS sectors to reflect the changes on HTML

Future Implementations:
In the future, I plan to implement additional features such as a contact form for users to get in touch with Horiseon.
